# Project Setup

1. Install Docker if you haven't already.
2. Create .env files based on .env.example. The headers for the .env parser can be found on any product page in the Steam market. While logged into Steam, use the developer tools, go to the Network tab, and check the headers in the requests.
3. Run `docker-compose up --build`.
